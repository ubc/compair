The existence of these non-euclidean sets suggests that it is possible that another universe contains a set of natural laws that are different than the set of natural laws our universe contains.</div><div><br></div><div>-It\'s also worth considering hyperbolic geometry, the first non-euclidean geometry. At first, (I believe) it was thought (by Gauss and other cognitive powerhouses) that hyperbolic geometry represented a discrete non-euclidean set of geometric axioms. However, it was later proven that the axioms of hyperbolic geometry were \'equiconsistent\' with the axioms of euclidean geometry. More specifically, the axioms of hyperbolic geometry just described how forms would look to an observer positioned within a sphere, observing forms cast on the inner surface of the sphere. We know that such a scenario is consistent with the axioms of euclidean geometry because we know that, in our universe, shapes can be cast on the inner surface of spheres. Therefore, the axioms of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry are not necessarily discrete. So, hyperbolic geometry serves as evidence that, to even the most powerful minds, a distinct self-consistent set can appear to be a logically possible discrete universe, when, in fact, it is not truly discrete.</div><div><br></div><div>-it\'s axiomatic that as one reduces the number of constraints in a consideration, its number of possibilities increases.

But if you did that, and if you had to do that to allow for the existence of a universe that contained a discrete set of natural laws, then you could say nothing of that universe, since (meaningfully) speaking of a thing requires conceiving of it, and if you could conceive of it, then you wouldn\'t have needed to shed the requirement that it must be conceivable.</div><div><br></div><div>In sum, I tend toward believing that it is not feasible to conceive of a universe that has a set of natural laws that are different than the natural laws our universe has.</div><div><br></div><div>Then again, Stephen Hawking, once speculated that the universe was created by another universe that had universe-creating properties and whose properties did not require it be created.

The basic principle which allows auxin to act in the organising way it does is that auxin is produced inside cells, and proteins which export auxin from a cell develop on the side of the cell which has the highest auxin concentration (see figure below).<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>So auxin gets transported up the concentration gradient of auxin! Thus if you get an area of high auxin concentration developing somehow, more auxin is then transported towards that area. An area of high auxin concentration relative to the surrounding tissue is called an auxin maximum (plural \'maxima\').</div><div><br></div><div>For most of the life of the plant, auxin is produced pretty much equally in most cells. However, at the very early stages of embryo development, it gets produced preferentially along the embryonic axis (see figure below, part 1). That creates a meristem - a group of cells where cell division is taking place - at the auxin maximum at each end of the embryo. Since this particular meristem is at the apex of the plant, it is called the apical meristem, and it is usually the strongest one in the plant.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>So by having a meristem at each end, the embryo then elongates as cell division is only taking place at those points. This leads to part 2 of the image above, where the two meristems get so far apart that the auxin gradient is so weak as to no longer have its organising effect (area in the red square). When that happens, the auxin produced in cells in that area concentrates in a chaotic way for a short time until another center of transport is created. This happens, as the first one did, when a particular area of the tissue has a slightly higher concentration of auxin, and so auxin in the surrounding tissue is transported towards it. This leads to part 3 of the figure, in which two new meristems are created on the sides of the plant (called lateral meristems).</div><div><br></div><div>Lateral meristems are where branches occur on plants. If you then imagine this process continuing to iterate over and over, you will see that the branches, as they elongate, will develop meristems at the tips and along the sides. The main stem will also continue elongating, and develop more lateral stems. The root will begin to branch, and those branches will branch, etc. If you can understand how this elegant system works, you understand how plants grow, and why they grow in repeating units as opposed to in a body plan like animals.</div><div><br></div><div>It also explains why, if you cut off the tip of a stem, it promotes branching.

When light hits the plant stem, the auxins that determine the length of the stem are destroyed, decreasing the amount of growth on that side of the stem. When this happens, the stems bend toward the light source from the imbalance of auxins in the stem. The reason that the shady side is weaker is that all trees rely on photosynthesis for their energy.

The four bases are able to copy with high reliability because two features combine to exclude mis-pairings: there are two size classes - meaning any purine-purine or pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairing results in incorrect separation between the strands, excluding A-G and C-U bonds; and there are two classes based on number of OH-bonds - which limits the potential for A-C and G-U bonds. More bases must, inevitably, weaken the strength of these exclusionary approaches and increase the number of mispairings. RNA world replicators will have lacked the sophisticated repair and error checking mechanisms of modern lifeforms so this increase in mispairings would likely not be corrected.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, a two base system would be even more capable of reducing errors. I suggest that the advantage of the four base system is that it allows for much more complex 3-dimensional structure to form in RNA and thus enabled a broader range of catalytic capabilities.

It approaches the problem from Claude Shannon\'s theory for communication. It treats DNA replication conceptually and mathematically the same as a data transmission. It concludes that the system of four bases, not two, not six, replicates the most genetic information at the shortest amount of time.</div><div><br></div><div>The communicational analogy goes like this. If you have two data transmission systems, one can transmit, say, 1 MB per second, and the other can do 2 MB per second but cost less than twice as much. The answer is obvious you will buy the second service for a higher rate per cost. As a data service, it does not care what information you consume -- it can be spam, video, audio, etc. All that matters is the transmission rate. As for DNA replication, it is like a data transmission channel when one base is replicated a time along the mother DNA template. It too does not care whether the process is for a bacterium genome, or a plant, or an animal genome. The pay-off is in information and the cost is in time. Unlike your abiotic communication varieties, time is both the sender and the receiver of all messages of life, and different life forms or species are merely time\'s cell phones. So if one system can replicate more information in a unit time than another, the faster one will win the evolutionary arm race. A prey operating on a slow replicator system will not be able to compete with nor to adapt to a predator operating on a fast one.</div><div><br></div><div>Now because the A-T pair has only two weak hydrogen bonds but the C-G pair has three, A and T take a shorter time to complete duplication than the C and G do. Although the replication time is short in some fraction of nano second, but the time adds up quickly for genomes with base pairs in the billions. So having the C-G pair may slow down the replication, but the gain is in information. One base pair gives you 1 bit per base information. Two pairs gives you 2 bits per base information. But, having more base pairs may eventually run into a diminished return in information replication rate if the new bases take too long a time to replicate. Hence the consideration for the optimal rate of replication measured in information bits per base per time. Without information there would be no diversity, no complexity. Without replication in information there would be no life.</div><div><br></div><div>Using a simple transmission/replication rate calculation by Shannon you can calculate the mean rate for the AT-system, the CG-system, the ATCG-system, and for some hypothetical 6-bases, 2n-bases system whose new bases take progressively longer time to replicate. The analysis shows the ATCG-system has the optimal replication rate if the CG bases take 1.65 to 3 times longer to replicate than the AT bases. That is, a base-2 system replicates its bases faster but does not carry more information to have a higher bit rate. Likewise, a base-6 system has a greater per-base information but replicate slower on average to end up with a suboptimal bit rate.</div><div><br></div><div><div>According to a comparison from the paper, the base-4 system is about 40% faster than the Aâ€“T only system, and 133% faster than the Gâ€“C only system. Assume life on Earth started about 4 billion years ago, then the A-T only system would set back evolution by 1 billion years, the Gâ€“C system would do so by 2.3 billion years. For a hypothetical base-6 system, it would do so by 80 million years. In other words, life is where it should be because the base-4 system is able to transmit information through the time bottleneck at the optimal bit rate.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, life is to replicate the most information with the shortest time, and the base-4 system does it the best. If ever there were other systems they would have lost the informatic competition to the base-4 system from the get-go. Darwin\'s principle works at life\'s most basic and most important level.</div><div><br></div><div>There are other explanations, all non-Darwinian. Most are based on the base\'s molecular structures. But these types of explanation border on circular argument -- using observations to explain themselves. They also face this catch-22 problem since there is no way to exhaust all possible bases for replication. However, such lines of exploration are fruitful regardless because more knowledge the better. But without taking information and its replication into consideration it is hard to imagine a sensible answer to the question.</div></div>'),(203,13,'CommentA','2013-08-27 17:12:05','Cool explanation.'),(204,14,'Script','2013-08-27 17:12:54','The 4-bases DNA system with A-T bonds and C-G bonds is the one that evolved to be used by most living creatures on Earth, as mentioned in other answers, because it can encode a triplet table of bases for all aminoacids used, allowing for some aminoacids to have more than one triplet code.

Trees, for example, have long trunks basically for one of two reasons.</div><div><br></div><div>Firstly to put their leaves and seeds out of the reach of herbivores, so we have a kind of arms race like that between giraffes and acacia trees in Africa.</div><div><br></div><div>Secondly, when they grow in close clumps like woods and forests, there will be competition for sunlight and soil resources like water. A species which can reach higher and put it\'s leaves above those of it\'s neighbours will win the competition and there will also then be pressure on it\'s neighbours to evolve longer trunks. Long trunks mean that water must be pumped a long way to the leaves so the tree with the longest trunks will also need bigger root systems. Again a trade off between making a long trunk and dominating the water supply underground.</div><div><br></div><div>Many trees are also believed to have formed symbiotic associations with fungi in their root systems which help them take in the nutrients and water required to \'service\' a long trunk and high-up leaf crown so they may be the only types of plants capable of doing this anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>One thing you might like to think about is why some whales are very big and some are relatively small (dolphins, porpoises, killer whales). What is the difference in their life-style, food, habitat, and so on, which could drive these evolutionary differences.</div>'),(225,5,'CommentA','2013-08-27 17:51:17','Thank you so much for such a detailed answer.'),(226,5,'Script','2013-08-27 17:51:44','<div>to expand on Rose\'s answer, certain environmental factors are what people cite with unusual size changes in an animal over time as it diversifies into new species.</div><div><br></div><div>Gigantism (and dwarfism) on islands are a particular example. In this case an animal may arrive on an island and some of the predators or competitors that it is used to will not be there. Then a single species will spin off many species, each one will fill one of the niches that are unfilled on the island - eating bugs from bark, breaking open nuts. The lack of large carnivores will allow a nice juicy herbivore to get larger without fear of being eaten. Similarly the Moa was a bird that became an aggressive carnivore in its island habitat, where it\'s very rare to see an aggressive land bird when a big cat or other carnivore is already present. Such large changes in environment can also result in dwarfism - smaller species as smaller animals like squirrels or mice might not be present to consume all the food that are available. The Hobbits recently discovered in Indonesia are an example of island dwarfism.</div><div><br></div><div>That being said, selective pressure can probably make many animals larger or smaller - lots of the dog breeds are smaller than wolves that they descended from. I think steers are as large as we can make them and are larger than native cattle stock.</div><div><br></div><div>As far as the environment that caused dinosaurs to be so large, the higher levels of oxygen on the planet at the time is a common theory for why they were so large. I also think that at least early on, the selection conditions that favored larger animals were probably put in place as animals evolved without any competitors whatsoever (first animals on land or sea). If this were to happen again, its not clear whether dinosaurs would have been so large - perhaps we could have had gigantic mammals or descendants of trilobites.</div>'),(227,6,'Script','2013-08-27 17:59:28','<div>It needs to be recognized that this is an outstanding question in biology, i.e., there is no certain answer.</div><div><br></div><div>This review considers the various theoretical and empirical evidence for phenotypic selection on body size:</div><div><br></div><div><i>Blanckenhorn WU (2000) The Evolution of Body Size: What Keeps Organisms Small?
