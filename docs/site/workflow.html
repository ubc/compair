                    <p>On the administrative side, instructors set up five structural elements for each assignment, a process that can be completed in under ten minutes.</p>

The default is "Which is better?"; however, instructors may change this to suit learning outcomes, add multiple criteria, and include a detailed explanation for each criterion. Instructions for peer feedback and self-evaluation can also be customized.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Comparison Settings</strong><br/> <span class="indented"> The number of answer pairs students will compare and how the pairs will be selected&mdash;at random or adaptively based on how students have ranked answers so far (learn <a href="best-practices.html#scoring">more about scoring here</a>).

                    <h2 class="sub-heading"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span> Submit an answer</h2>
                    <p>When registered students log in, they can see all active assignments for a course and select the assignment they wish to answer. When answering, students can use rich text, a file attachment, or both.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Instructors and teaching assistants may also submit answers of their own for assignments (and optionally include these for comparison with student answers) or upload on behalf of a student (e.g., if a student misses the answer deadline).</p>

                    <h2 class="sub-heading"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></span> Compare and comment</h2>
                    <p>After answering, students compare pairs of peer answers. Each pair is considered a "round". A round starts with students selecting a preferred answer from the pair for each instructor-set criterion. Then students write feedback to the author of each answer, using instructor-set instructions.</p>
                    <div class="thumbnail">

                    </div>
                    <p>At the end of each round, students submit their criteria selections and feedback together. After submitting, they are automatically directed to the next pair of answers until they have completed the required number of comparisons, though they may leave and return to the work at a later time.</p>
                    <p>If instructors enable self-evaluation, students are asked to evaluate and comment on their own answer at the end of the process, again using instructor-set instructions.</p>

                    <h2 class="sub-heading"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-list"></span> View results</h2>
                    <p>Once the assignment completes, students can access the peer feedback given to their own answer, as well as the full list of answers submitted by their peers. Depending on how instructors set up the assignment, students may also see the answers ranked most highly by their peers (if scoring is used, though the scores are hidden from students) and/or answers marked as "top" answers by instructors or teaching assistants.</p>

During and after an assignment, instructors and teaching assistants can read and comment (privately or publicly) on student answers, access a participation table to view activity and participation grades, mark "top" answers, and view each student's comparison outcomes and peer feedback for the answer pairs presented (as well as the self-evaluation, if enabled).</p>
